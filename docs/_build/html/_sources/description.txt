This gpl tool is meant to be an aide in the process of developing ZenPacks from scratch.
The goal of this project is to reduce the amount of time it takes to create a zenpack by taking a json formatted input file and generating a directory structure containing prepopulated files.

This generator will perform many tasks for you but not all of them.  At some point you will need
to leave the generator and tweak the ZenPack by hand.


The ZenPack Generator will perform these operations for you

* Layout the ZenPack directory Structure.

* Pre-populate many sections of boilerplate.

* Create the root __init__.py file.

* Create a Configure.zcml file for UI JavaScript registration.

* Create Components.

* Create Relationships between Components.

* Create most of the JavaScript for the UI.

The ZenPack Generator will NOT perform these operations.

* Create custom modelers.

* Create RRDTemplates.

* Update the objects.xml
