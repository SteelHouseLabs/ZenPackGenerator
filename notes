# 1 <-> 1 readme.txt
# 1 <-> 1 setup.py  (could autogenerate most of this) (customizations possible)


__init__.py   (zenchkschema relations/products) (define namespace in the logger)











component
    imports
    
    module_methods()    

    class
      meta 
      attributes

      properties
 
      relationships

      factory_type (deprecated mostly, turns on/off component template view)

      device()

      getRRDTemplateName()
      custom_methods()
    initializeclass

a device is an edge case component.


relationships are the challenge here.
a way to autogenerate manytomany non container relationships?





interfaces
    generated from attributes.  "Need a singular and plural"  eg Version/Versions

facades
     mostly code
info
    generated from attributes.
    and from the number of components in a relationship

    mostly from new relationships.

routers
    ADD MENUS
